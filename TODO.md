# Canvas MCP Server Development TODO

## Completed Features âœ…

### **FERPA Compliance Implementation** 
**Status: COMPLETED** - All 8 core tools now include comprehensive privacy protection with production-ready error handling.

- [x] All tools that return student data are modified to use the `anonymize_response_data` function
- [x] Running tools like `list_discussion_entries` no longer exposes student names in the output
- [x] The `create_student_anonymization_map` tool successfully creates CSV files in the correct format
- [x] The `local_maps/` directory and its contents are correctly ignored by Git
- [x] Anonymous IDs are consistent across tool calls
- [x] Canvas User IDs are preserved for faculty identification
- [x] No PII leakage in error messages or logs

## Development Notes

**API Considerations:**
- Canvas Analytics APIs have 4-24 hour data delays but higher rate limits
- All analytics tools must integrate with existing anonymization framework
- Batch requests where possible to minimize API calls
- Implement intelligent caching for repeated analytics queries

**Educational Focus:**
- Prioritize actionable insights over raw data presentation
- Ensure tools provide specific intervention recommendations
- Design for non-technical educator users
- Include comparative benchmarks and context for metrics
