When Claude Code Becomes Your Co-Developer: Building a Canvas LMS Tool That Actually Works

A 4-month journey from "I hate clicking through Canvas" to "Holy sh*t, Claude just wrote 3,000 lines of educational AI"

Picture this: It's 11:47 PM on a Tuesday. I'm staring at my Canvas dashboard, clicking through the same menus I've clicked through a thousand times before. Assignment submissions here, grade distributions there, trying to figure out which of my 180 students might be struggling and need extra support.

Sound familiar?

Here's what hit me that night: Canvas is brilliant, but it wasn't built for the way educators actually think.

I don't want to click through seventeen screens to answer "Which students haven't engaged with discussions this week?" I want to ask that question directly and get an answer. Like, you know, having a conversation with someone who actually understands my courses.

The wild part? I'm not a developer. I'm an educator who got curious about whether Claude Code could build something that actually made sense.

Four months later, Claude Code is literally listed as a contributor on my GitHub project. Not as an assistant. As a contributor.

Let me tell you how we got here.

The "Wait, What?" Moment: When AI Development Actually Makes Sense

Here's the thing about traditional software development—it's designed for developers, not educators. You want a simple tool to analyze discussion participation? Cool, that'll be 6 months of learning React, Node.js, database design, API development, authentication, deployment, and maintenance.

No thanks.

Claude Code flipped this entire model on its head with something called the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Instead of building apps, you build "tools" that Claude can use directly.

Think of it like this: Instead of teaching yourself Spanish to order food in Mexico, you bring along a translator who already speaks both languages fluently.

Here's what blew my mind:

• Natural Language Interface: "Show me grade distributions for my Biology course" → Claude figures out the API calls
• No Frontend/Backend Nonsense: Write focused tools, Claude handles the interface
• Local and Secure: Everything runs on your machine, no sketchy cloud services
• Start Small, Dream Big: Begin with "list my courses" and evolve to advanced analytics

The moment I realized this was possible, I knew we were in uncharted territory. Not "AI helps developers code faster" territory. More like "AI becomes your co-developer" territory.

The Journey: From "Can This Work?" to "Holy Crap, It Actually Works"

Phase 1: The Proof of Concept (February 2025)

February 27th, 2025. First commit. I literally just wanted to know: "Can I make Claude talk to Canvas?"

The answer? A resounding "yes" wrapped in 200 lines of Python that could list my courses.

But here's what I learned immediately: When you're building with AI, you think differently about architecture from day one. Not because you're smarter, but because Claude thinks about edge cases and security patterns that you might skip when you're just trying to make something work.

Key decisions that shaped everything:
• Security obsession: API tokens in environment variables, never in code (Claude insisted)
• Type safety everywhere: Even for simple functions (again, Claude's influence)
• FastMCP foundation: Chose the most robust framework, not the quickest (guess who suggested that)

Phase 2: The "Oh Shit, This Is Real" Phase (March-April 2025)

March hit different. What started as "list my courses" became assignment management, submission tracking, peer review workflows, discussion forum integration. The codebase exploded to 800+ lines.

Plot twist: mgckind submitted pull requests adding group management features. First external contributor! Someone else saw what we were building and wanted to contribute. That's when you know you're onto something.

But here's the real kicker—Canvas's API is complex. Want to know which students haven't submitted assignments? That's not one API call. That's like 7 API calls, with pagination, error handling, and data normalization.

Claude Code handled all of that complexity while I focused on "what do educators actually need?"

Phase 3: The Architecture Revolution (June 2025)

By June, we had 3,000 lines of code and a problem: it was getting unwieldy. Time for the big refactor.

Claude Code basically said: "Hey, let's build this like we mean it."

What emerged:
• Modular architecture: Core utilities, domain-specific tools, comprehensive documentation
• Advanced features: Rubric-based grading, student analytics, performance tracking
• Real educational workflows: Not just "Canvas API wrapper" but "how educators actually think"

Here's the wild part: Check the GitHub contributors list. Claude Code is listed as a contributor. Not "assisted by Claude." Not "powered by AI." Listed as a contributor.

This isn't human-using-AI. This is human-collaborating-with-AI.

We are literally witnessing the birth of a new kind of software development partnership.

What We Built: The Tools That Actually Matter

After 4 months of iteration, here's what we ended up with—tools that solve real problems, not theoretical ones:

Course Management (AKA "Stop Clicking Through Menus")
The Problem: Getting a simple overview of your courses requires 47 browser tabs and a spreadsheet.

What We Built:
• Ask Claude: "Show me all my courses with enrollment numbers and upcoming deadlines"
• Get instant comprehensive summaries across multiple courses
• Navigate complex module structures with plain English

Grading Workflows (AKA "Please God, Automate This")
The Problem: Grading 180 assignments means repetitive clicking, manual calculations, and inconsistent feedback.

What We Built:
• Bulk assignment analysis: "Which students haven't submitted anything this week?"
• Rubric-based grading with automated scoring and detailed feedback
• Peer review assignment and tracking (set it and forget it)

Student Support (AKA "Early Warning System")
The Problem: By the time you realize a student is struggling, it's often too late.

What We Built:
• Discussion forum monitoring and AI-powered response suggestions
• Early intervention analytics: "Show me students with declining participation"
• Consistent, personalized feedback using rubric criteria

Administrative Sanity (AKA "The Boring Stuff That Takes Forever")
The Problem: Scheduling announcements, exporting grades, managing enrollments—death by a thousand clicks.

What We Built:
• Scheduled announcements that actually work
• One-click gradebook export with analytics
• Bulk user operations that don't make you want to cry

The key insight: Instead of building "Canvas but better," we built "Canvas but conversational."

The Technical Stuff (For Those Who Care)

Look, I know some of you are wondering: "But how does it actually work?"

Fair question. Here's the breakdown for the technically curious:

The Architecture That Claude Built

2,767 lines of code organized like this:
• Tools (2,136 lines): The actual Canvas operations educators need
• Core (553 lines): The boring but critical infrastructure stuff
• Resources (78 lines): Documentation and configuration

Why does this matter? Because when you want to modify how grading works, you don't need to understand the entire codebase. Just the grading module.

Type Safety (Claude's Obsession)
Every single function uses comprehensive type hints and validation.

Translation: Claude insisted on bulletproof code that tells you exactly what went wrong when things break. Which they do. Often.

Performance That Actually Matters
Remember those 7 API calls I mentioned for simple operations? We cache aggressively and run requests concurrently.

Result: "Show me analytics for all my courses" completes in 3 seconds instead of 3 minutes.

The Philosophy
We didn't build this to be clever. We built it to be reliable. Every decision prioritized "will this work consistently for an educator at 11 PM on a Tuesday?" over "look how smart we are."

#VibeCoding at its finest.

The Results: What Actually Changed

Here's what I discovered after using this system for real course management:

Time Compression
That 45-minute weekly ritual of checking assignment submissions, calculating participation, and identifying at-risk students? Now it's a 2-minute conversation with Claude.

"Show me students who haven't engaged with discussions this week and are behind on assignments."

Done. List appears. Interventions can start immediately instead of next Tuesday.

Earlier Interventions
When Claude can instantly cross-reference discussion participation, assignment submissions, and rubric performance, you catch struggling students weeks earlier.

This isn't theoretical. This is "I reached out to Sarah three weeks sooner and helped her pass the course" real.

Teaching Decisions Based on Actual Data
Remember those Canvas analytics you never had time to check? Now they're part of regular conversations.

"Which discussion topics generated the most engagement this semester?"
"What rubric criteria are students struggling with most?"

Answers inform next week's lessons, not next semester's curriculum revisions.

Your Turn: Get Started Without Losing Your Mind

Want to try this? Here's the honest setup guide:

What You Need
• Canvas access (with API permissions)
• Claude Desktop
• 15 minutes and basic comfort with following setup instructions

The Setup (Actually Simple)
1. Download and configure: Clone the project, add your Canvas API credentials
2. Install dependencies: One pip install command
3. Connect to Claude Desktop: Add the MCP server to your config
4. Test: Ask Claude to "list my courses" and watch the magic

Start Here (Not Advanced Analytics)
• "Show me my course enrollments"
• "What assignments are due this week?"
• "Give me a summary of discussion participation"

Build familiarity before attempting the complex stuff. Trust me on this.

Pro Tips From Experience
• Start small: Course listing before complex analytics
• Know your Canvas setup: The tool surfaces existing data, so understanding your course structure helps
• Document what works: Keep notes on useful commands
• Iterate gradually: Add complexity as you get comfortable

What I Learned: The Real Insights

After 4 months of genuine AI-human collaboration, here are the patterns that emerged:

AI as Co-Developer is Real
Having Claude Code as a GitHub contributor isn't a gimmick. The AI genuinely improved the architecture, suggested security patterns I wouldn't have considered, and wrote documentation that's clearer than what I would have produced alone.

This isn't "AI helps you code faster." This is "AI thinks about your code differently and makes it better."

Incremental Beats Comprehensive
Every instinct says "build everything at once." Every successful feature started with "let's just make course listing work."

The magic happens in iteration. Start simple, discover what you actually need, evolve gradually.

Documentation is Everything
1,000+ lines of documentation isn't excessive—it's essential. Educational tools need non-technical explanations or they don't get adopted.

Claude's obsession with clear documentation saved this project.

Open Source Works for Education
mgckind's contributions proved something important: educators building for educators creates better tools than developers building for educators.

The community knows what it needs.

What's Next: The Vision

This is just the beginning. What we've proven is that MCP + Claude Code creates a new category of possibility:

Short-term roadmap:
